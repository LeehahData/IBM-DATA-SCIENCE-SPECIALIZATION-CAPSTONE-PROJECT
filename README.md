# INTRODUCTION
## Project background and context
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. This goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.

## Problems you want to find answers
What factors determine if the rocket will land successfully?

The interaction amongst various features that determine the success rate of a successful landing.

# METHODOLOGY
## Data collection methodology:

1. Data was collected using SpaceX API and web scraping from Wikipedia. 

2. Perform data wrangling

    One-hot encoding was applied to categorical features
    
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL

    The table was created on Ibm-db2 database and was connected to Jupyter notebook

4. Perform interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash

5. Perform predictive analysis using classification models
    
    How to build, tune, evaluate classification models
